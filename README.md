How To Play:

Use the direction keys to move. Wear headphones. That's it.
The orange stuff that flashes at the start are obstacles, you can't go through them.

Sources:

All the "artwork" is mine.
Footstep sound taken from here: https://freesound.org/people/carrigsound/sounds/32635/
Flashing sound effect from Base FL Studio 12: Drums (Mode Audio) -> Percussion -> Hyper Roulette Alloy Perc
Growling sound effects taken from my broken voice box.


Notes of interest:

- Not very happy with how the game turned out, but whatever, they can't all be winners.
- With more time, I would have made the panning better. Right now, it can make your ears bleed.
- The monster gets faster over time.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
